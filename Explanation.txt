File to run: "weekFour.java"

Deliverable: Create a program that displays days of the week using an enum to capture the days.
Use a super and subclass in your program. (Week 4, Backend Beginner)

Concepts:
Enum: Enums (short for enumerations) represent a set of fixed constants (values that don't change)
Superclass: Is a parent class that provides its properties and methods to its subclasses
Subclass: A child class that inherits the properties and methods of its superclass

Code explanation:

"Day.java" holds the enum for the days of the week.
The enum holds both the day of the week and a variable called "Information Index" that determines
the information of that day

The "weekFour.java" holds the rest of the code.
It holds the superclass "Week" and its subclass "DayInformation".

The "Week" class contains code that translates the "Information Index" from the enum into
the appropriate string.

The "DayInformation" is the class that is instantiated and prints out the days of the week.
